Next step:

openCV's attempt to infer the 3D coordinates of the joints is poor, as shown by animated plotting of coordinates - definitely insufficient to use 1 video for analyses from all angles. Can perhaps do a review from the side & a review from rear/front.

update figure to fit whole diagram on axes - should probably be an argument based on the max and min values from the body parts
