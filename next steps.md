main is where the action is happening.
I haven't deleted test copy.py as that is where I have gotten the plotting of points in 3d space & animated to work

Next step:
send data for all body points we want to be analysed - should probably test this in the "test copy.py" - see how we can get it to handle a list of lists of np arrays ...!!
update figure to fit whole diagram on axes - should probably be an argument based on the max and min values from the body parts ygm
